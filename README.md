# Part 1 

The three commands I picked here: 

* netstat - shows network routes, interfaces, and connections 
* df - shows disk usage 
* free - shows memory usage 

#Part 2 

My manual html is in who.html, which uses whostyle.css. 

#Part 3 

The relevant files for part 3 are: 

* part3b.cgi - this file gets output from various unix commands, as well as the output from trainsched, and passes it to tt2ht1 for html conversion. 
* tt2ht1.c - this program creates an html table from a text table. 
* tt2ht1 - the compiled command 

#Part 4 

The relevant files for part 3 are: 

* part4b.cgi - This file combines part4b.top and who.output as inputs for the table converter. 
* part4b.top - This text file contains some XML tags that the table converter uses. 
* tt2ht1.c - this program is the table converter. It creates an html table from a text table, and can be configured using tags in the xml 
* tt2ht1 - the compiled command
